# xrdp-modern-login

## Overview
After you have performed an XRDP installation, you should see the standard 
and slightly dated XRDP login screen.  The idea is to modernize the XRDP 
login screen a little, using the configuration (colors and positions) and
combining it with the possibility of adding a custom image.

## Quick Start

The XRDP customization possibilities are limited.  To change the lookâ€™n feel
of the xRDP login screen, you need to edit the file `/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini`.  
The colors we use are quite basic and minimalist, always keep in mind that 
you can modify them to your liking. This customization gives you an idea of
how to do something new.

This is what the customization looks like once finished:

**Note:** The image shared in the repository does not have the avatar or the
name of my server (danbo), it is an image that you can edit (with the image 
editor of your choice) and customize and add the details to your liking.
